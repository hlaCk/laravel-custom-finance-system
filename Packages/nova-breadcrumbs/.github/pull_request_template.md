## Before creating a pull request!

If you are creating a pull request simply to change the supported version of Nova, STOP! Read the readme first, and understand what you actually need to do and why the version constraint is in the package in the first place.

If you do want to assist by updating this package for a newer version of Nova, then you will need to ensure that it is correctly version locked, the readme has been updated and the assets have been recompiled using the ```build/production.sh``` file.

Aside from the above, fixes and enhancements are always welcome.
